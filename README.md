# CoinAnalyzer
A simple web page running on Node server for analyzing Bitcoin's data between given dates. 
This was done in quite a hurry so the project might contain somewhat crude code in places.

# To run application, simply download files and in the directory of the files the command "node server.js" starts the server.
# Navigate to "localhost:5000" on browser to see the application.
